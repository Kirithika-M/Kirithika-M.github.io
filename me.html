                Hello everyone!
                <br><br>
                My name is M Kirithika, and I am currently an undergraduate student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree at SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) located in Vadapalani. My passion for technology has driven me to immerse myself in this ever-evolving field, where the possibilities seem limitless.
                <br><br>
                As a CSE student, I am particularly drawn to the many facets of technology that shape our daily lives, from software development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I find the intricacies of computer systems and programming languages fascinating, and I am eager to deepen my understanding of these concepts. I aspire to not only grasp theoretical knowledge but also gain practical experience that will enable me to tackle real-world challenges.
